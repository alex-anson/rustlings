    the difference is how these two types deal with memory --

    since the contents of a string literal are known at compile time, the text is
    hardcoded directly into the final executable.

    String type - to be able to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need
    to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold
    the contents. this means --
    - the memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
    - we need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're done with
    our `String`.
    part one - we call `String::from`, and its implementation requests the needed memory.
    part two - rust's approach is different than other languages that don't have
    garbage collectors - the memory is automatically returned once the variable
    that owns it goes out of scope. rust calls a special Æ’n for us, `drop`. it's
    called at the closing curly bracket. (seems simple, but can cause unexpected
    behavior in more complicated situations.)
