    the difference is how these two types deal with memory --

    since the contents of a string literal are known at compile time, the text is
    hardcoded directly into the final executable.

    String type - to be able to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need
    to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold
    the contents. this means --
    - the memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
    - we need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're done with
    our `String`.
    part one - we call `String::from`, and its implementation requests the needed memory.
    part two - rust's approach is different than other languages that don't have
    garbage collectors - the memory is automatically returned once the variable
    that owns it goes out of scope. rust calls a special ∆ín for us, `drop`. it's
    called at the closing curly bracket. (seems simple, but can cause unexpected
    behavior in more complicated situations.)

    - a String is made up of three parts: a pointer to the memory that holds the
    contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. this group of data is stored
    on the stack. the heap holds the contents of s1.
    length = how much memory, in bytes, the contents of `String` are currently using.
    capacity = total amount of memory, in bytes, that the string has received from
    the allocator.
    - s1 and s2 share the data on the heap, that data is not copied. s2 has its own
    pointer (which points to the same location in memory as does s1), length, and
    capacity.
    ... sounds similar to how objects in javascript work. (except not now that i've
    continued reading!)
    - to avoid causing a "double free" error that would occur if rust called the
    `drop` function twice on the same memory (the same data on the heap), to ensure
    memory safety, rust considers s1 no longer valid right after the `let s2 = s1;`

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function
is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take
ownership?*Ô∏è‚É£ It‚Äôs quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed
back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body
