    /*
    This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next
    to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might
    require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space,
    if there isnâ€™t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where
    the vector is currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element
    would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs
    from ending up in that situation.
