/* SUMMARY (The Book)
Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By
using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other
and name each piece to make your code clear. In impl blocks, you can define
functions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of associated
function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your structs have.
